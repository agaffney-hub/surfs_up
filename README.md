# surfs_up

## Overview:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the temperature and precipitation trends in a location being considered for a potential surf shop investment. The investor wants assurance that the area has favorable weather conditions before moving forward. Our goal is to review the data and help the investor make an informed decision.

## Results:
- There are around 200 more recorded June temperatures than December.
- The differences are minor between the two months from the overall data, as each data point is only a few degrees away from each other.

The changes in temperatures are very minor between the two months since even the maximum temperatures for each set are very close together.
