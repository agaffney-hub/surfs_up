# surfs_up

## Overview:
The reason behind this project is to be able to figure out the temperature and precipitation for a potential surf shop investment we could be given. The investor want to know that the shop has good weather climates in the location it is in before investing, so our goal is to go through data and see if this investor believes this is the right call for us.

## Results:
- There are around 200 more recorded June temperatures than December.
- The differences are minor between the two months from the overall data, as each data point is only a few degrees away from each other.

## Summary:
Based on what the investor is looking for, this is a good investment for what the potential investor wants, as well as for our business opportunities in the future. The changes in temperatures are very minor between the two months since even the maximum temperatures for each set are very close together.
